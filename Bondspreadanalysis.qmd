# Introduction {#sec-intro} 





This paper is structured as follows: @sec-lit is the literature review situating the research question, @sec-des contains the preliminary analyses, @sec-met contains the methodology, @sec-res contains the results, and @sec-hyp has the hypothesis testing. 


Higher spread = higher perceived risk

# Firm value and capital structure ratios

Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash
EVtoSales measures how expensive a company is relative to its revnue 
High EV/Sales -> market expects high growth OR company is overvalued
High EV -> lower PERCEIVED risk -> lower spreads

PPE is actual long-term assets (machines, buildings, equipment)
High EV/PPE -> growth-oriented
High EV/PPE -> riskier -> higher spreads

High P/S -> confidence -> lower spreads

Book Value = Assets - Liabilities 
P/B <1 -> undervaluation -> financial distress -> higher spreads

Dividend yield -> higher MAY indicate risk

High RATE -> more efficient -> lower spreads

# profitability and operational efficiency 

operating margin = earnings before interest and taxes/revenue 
high margin -> lower default risk (firm is efficient) -> lower spreads

High total capital expenses to total assets -> lower spreads or less cash :\

low book value per share -> maybe bankrupt

High asset turnover -> efficient -> lower spreads

# Liquidity and Cash flow ratios

current ratio = current assets (cash + receivables + inventory)/ current liabilities (obligations due)
low current ratio -> liquidity risk -> higher spreads

Cash dividend coverage ratio = operating cash flow/cash dividends paid
lower coverage -> weak cash flow -> higher spreads

# Leverage and Capital Structure

high total debt/shareholder equity -> in debt -> higher spreads

high total debt/(total debt + equity) -> high reliance on debt -> high spreads

# Bond specific

Higher amount outstanding -> lower spreads (more liquid?)
smaller amount outstanding -> higher spreads

years to maturity -> more interest rate and credit risk -> higher spread (risk premium) 

low couponds -> high price sensitity? MAYBE. Higher does not not imply higher here



SLR assumptions:
linearity in parameters
Random sampling
no perfect colllnearity
Zero conditional mean
Homoskedasticity
(1-4) unbiased ness 
add 5 to get BLUE
6 is normality

## Description of variables

The variables are as follows

| Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Issuer  | Name of the company that issued the bond |
| Spread | The difference between the bond's yield and the yield on a government bond of the same maturity. Measured in bps |
| Ticker Parent  | Identifier for the parent company |
| **Enterprise Value to Sales** | Measures how expensive a company is relative to its revenue |
| Enterprise Value to PPE | Measures valuation relative to tangible assets |
| **Price to Sales** | How much investors pay for $1 of revenue |
| **Price to Book Value** | Measures how expensive the firm is relative to accounting equity |
| Dividend Yield | Return shareholders receive from dividends |
| **Return on Average Total Equity** | How efficient the firm is with investments |
| **Operating Margin** | Core profibility measure |
| Total Capital Expenses to Total Assets | How much firm invests in long-term assets |
| Book Value per Share | Accounting value per share |
| **Asset Turnover** | Measures how well assets generate revenue |
| **Current Ratio** | Measures short-term liquidity |
| **Cash Dividend Coverage Ratio** | Measures if firm can pay dividends purely from operations |
| **Total Debt to Equity** | Measures financial leverage |
| **Total Debt to Total Capital** | Shows how much of capital is from debt |
| Amount Outstanding | Size of the bond |
| Years to Maturity | Number of years until the bond pays back its principal |
| Coupon | Annual payments made to bond holders |

Spread is numeric with a range from [-196.8, 395.8]. It had a mean of -14.6 and a standard deviation of 57.6. It had skweness of 1.017

PricetoBook Value is numeric with a range from [-10.3, 7.1]. It had a mean of 0.214 and a standard deviation of 1.17. It had skewness of 0.106.

Return on Average total equity was numeric with a range [-90.96, 135.03]. It had a mean of -0.47 and a standard deviation of 19.466. It had a skweness of 1.236.

Current Ratio is numeric with a range from [-1.47, 3.27]. It had a mean of -0.14 and a standard deviation of 0.395. It had a skewness of 2.86.


## Statement of hypothesis/research question

The research question this paper will seek to answer is what are the micro determinants of credit spread. We propose the following model 

$y= \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_1+\beta_{2}x_2$

Where $y$ is the spread of bonds, $x_1$ is ...


# Literature Review {#sec-lit}
do now
"For banks, credit spread can be an indicator of the profitability or risk premium related to a lender providing a loan to an individual borrower. The credit spread accounts for the maturity, liquidity, credit risk, and creditworthiness of borrowers. In this study, credit spread is defined as the difference between the loan rate and risk-free rate." [@u2021investigating]

@collin2001determinants:
book value (more leverage -> higher spreads)

"Hence, it is clear that credit spreads are expected to increase with leverage. Likewise, credit spreads should be a decreasing function of the firm's return on equity, all else equal." @collin2001determinants

"Implied volatility smiles in observed option prices suggest that markets account for the probability of large negative jumps in firm value. Thus, increases in either the probability or the magnitude of a negative jump should increase credit spreads."@collin2001determinants


Total Debt to Equity + Total Debt to Total Capital @fu2021credit
"we assess the existence of a firm leverage effect"
"firm leverage appears to have a significant influence"

@wang2023liquidity
ROE “Return on net assets… the higher the ROE, the better the operating conditions and the ability to service debt.”
higher -> lower spreads
Current Ratio "“The higher the current ratio, the better the ability to service debt…the smaller the credit spread.”"

@kaviani2020policy
Operating Margin "“…operating income-to-sales ratio…"

@carvalho2023loan
Price to book value (Market-to-book) "“Borrower-level controls include Equity Volatility, Size, Firm Age, Profitability, Tangibility, Market-to-Book, Leverage, Rated.”"
amount outstanding (loan amount) “I define the net notional amount of credit risk outstanding for a given firm as:
NOf,t is analogous to the face value of debt outstanding in bond markets—it captures the net amount of protection sold…”
Years to maturity (loan maturity) “…a firm is defined as a combination of the underlying firm (e.g. Ford) and a maturity bucket (e.g. 0-2 years)… The maturity buckets I consider are (in years): 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and 10+.”

[@collin2001determinants] added total debt to equity and enterprice valuue to sales.
