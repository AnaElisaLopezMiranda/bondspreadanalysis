# Introduction {#sec-intro} 

Finding the micro-determinants for credit bonds is useful for finding what affects yields over time. The yield that investors require to purchase a firm's bond is  the spread over the yield  provided by a comparable government bond. Micro-determinants are variables taht are related to the probability of default and the liquidity associated with a specific bond issue. This project seaks to assess the importance of firm specific factors in determining the spread for its bonds. The data used covered two points in time: 2022 and 2024. The model is a cross-sectional problem focusing on the changes in spread from 2022 to 2024. Fixed effects were not included as these were not vary across bonds. 

This paper is structured as follows: @sec-lit is the literature review situating the research question, @sec-des contains the preliminary analyses, @sec-met contains the methodology, @sec-res contains the results, and @sec-hyp has the hypothesis testing.

## Description of variables

There are 861 observations encompassing 34 categories. The variables are as follows

| Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Issuer  | Name of the company that issued the bond |
| Spread | The difference between the bond's yield and the yield on a government bond of the same maturity. Measured in bps |
| Ticker Parent  | Identifier for the parent company |
| Enterprise Value to Sales | Measures how expensive a company is relative to its revenue |
| Enterprise Value to PPE | Measures valuation relative to tangible assets |
| Price to Sales | How much investors pay for $1 of revenue |
| Price to Book Value | Measures how expensive the firm is relative to accounting equity |
| Dividend Yield | Return shareholders receive from dividends |
| Return on Average Total Equity | How efficient the firm is with investments |
| Operating Margin | Core profibility measure |
| Total Capital Expenses to Total Assets | How much firm invests in long-term assets |
| Book Value per Share | Accounting value per share |
| Asset Turnover | Measures how well assets generate revenue |
| Current Ratio | Measures short-term liquidity |
| Cash Dividend Coverage Ratio | Measures if firm can pay dividends purely from operations |
| Total Debt to Equity | Measures financial leverage |
| Total Debt to Total Capital | Shows how much of capital is from debt |
| Amount Outstanding | Size of the bond |
| Years to Maturity | Number of years until the bond pays back its principal |
| Coupon | Annual payments made to bond holders |

Enterprise value to sales measures how expensive a company is relative to its revenue. Thus, a high ratio means the market expects high growth (or the company is overvalued). Thus, a high enterprise value to sales means lower perceived risk and lower spreads.

PPE is tangible long-term assets. Thus, a high enterprise value to PPE means the firm is growth-oriented, but that also means has more risk and higher spreads. 

A high Price to Sales signifies higher confidence in the firm by the general public which indicates lower spreads. 

Price to Book Value is how the firm is valued by the general public. A lower ratio indicates undervaluation which produces financial distress and higher spreads. 

Divident yield is how much bond holders are receiving from the dividents. A higher ration may indicate higher risk.

A higher Return on Average total equity indicates the firm is more efficient which means lower spreads. 

The operating margin shows how much earnings are received before interest and taxes. A higher margin indicates the firm has a lower risk of going default which means lower spreads. 

A high total capital expenses to total assets could indicate either lower spreads or a lack of liquidy.

A low book value per share may indicate the firm is close to going default and thus have a higher spread. 
A high asset turnover indicates the efficiency which implies lower spreads

A low current ratio indicates liquidity risk which implies higher spreads.

A low cash dividend coverage ratio indicates weak cash flow which implies higher spreads

A high total debt to equity means the firm has a high reliance on debt which implies higher spreads


## Statement of hypothesis/research question

The research question this paper will seek to answer is what are the micro-determinants of credit spread. We propose that total debt to equity, price to book value, return on average total equity, and current ratioare the micro-determinants affect the change in bond spreads over time.


# Literature Review {#sec-lit}

In "Credit Default Swap Spreads", Fu et. al employed a multi-factor analysis from both a firm-specific and market-specific perspective to examine the determinants of credit spreads in the USA, the UK, and Japan between 2005 and 2012. Their results indicated that the degree of firm leverage has a siginificant influence on spreads. They mention re-testing the influence of leverage on spreads as done in Collin-Dufresne et al. in 2001 @collin2001determinants and Aunon-Nerin et al. in 2002 @aunon2002exploring. From the data used, leverage is seen in Total Debt to Equity. 

In "Liquidity of Corporate Bonds and Credit Spread", Wang examined corporate bond liquidity's impact on credit spreads for listed companies in China. He found that the better the liquidity of listed corporate bonds, the smaller the credit spread. He found that "the higher the ROE, the higher the current ratio, the better the ability to service debt...the smaller the credit spread" [@wang2023liquidity]. From the data used, return on net assets can be seen as Return on Average Total Equity, and Current ratio is directly used in the data. 

In "Loan Spreads and Credit Cycles", Carvalho et. al find evidence that lender optimism can lead to excessive fluctuations in credit spreads. Carvalho means "Equity Volatility, Size, Firm Age, Profibility, Tangibility, M/B (market-to-book), Leverage..." as determinants for bond spreads [@carvalho2023loan]. From the data used, Price to Book Value corresponds with Market-to-book

## Summary of key variables

Spread is numeric with a range from [-196.8, 395.8]. It had a mean of -14.6 and a standard deviation of 57.6. It had skweness of 1.017

PricetoBook Value is numeric with a range from [-10.3, 7.1]. It had a mean of 0.214 and a standard deviation of 1.17. It had skewness of 0.106.

Return on Average total equity was numeric with a range [-90.96, 135.03]. It had a mean of -0.47 and a standard deviation of 19.466. It had a skweness of 1.236.

Current Ratio is numeric with a range from [-1.47, 3.27]. It had a mean of -0.14 and a standard deviation of 0.395. It had a skewness of 2.86.

Total Debt to Equity is numeric with range from [-80.36, 452.69]. It had a mean of 30.07 and a standard deviation of 39.65. It had a skewness of 39.65. 

# Methodology {#sec-met}
## Clear statement of the model and its assumptions

$$
\Delta y_i= \beta_{0}+2\beta_{1}log(|x_{i1}|)+\beta_{2}x_{i2} + 2\beta_{3}log(|x_{i3}|)+\beta_{4}x_{i4}^{3}
$$

Where $\Delta y$ is the difference in the spread of bonds from 2022 to 2024, 

$x_1$ is the difference in Total Debt to Equity.
$x_2$ is the difference in Price to Book Value.
$x_3$ is the different in Return on Average Total Equity.
$x_4$ is the difference in Current Ratio.

**Linearity in Parameters**

From the model above, it is clear that the model is linear in parameters. 

**Random Sampling** 

This is an assumption about the data given. It is randomly sampled. 

**No Perfect Collinearity**

We ran correlation between all the variables and got the following table. Since none of the columns are a repeat, there is no perfect collinearity.

![](collinearityy.png){width=50%, fig-align="center"}
**Zero Conditional Mean**

This is an assumption about the population. 

**Homoskedasticty**

We performed robust on all our entries and did not assume homoskedasticity. 

Thus, following all these assumptions, the model is consistent and unbiased

## Specification tests

Before Adjusting for non linearity: F(12,809) value for estat ovtest, rhs ( linearity test)  = 6.22 with p value 0.0000 

After adjusting for non linearity (the model with logs and nooooo cubes) : estat ovtest, rhs F(12, 46) value is 1.46 with p-value 0.1749

The estat ovtest (test for omitted variable bias) only run after adjusting for non linearity gave F(3,55) value 1.55 with p-value 0.2129


## Robustness considerations 

For robustness considerations, we used robust every time we used regression. Thus, we never assumed homoskedasticity.

# Hypothesis Testing {#sec-hyp}

## Choise of appropriate test

We chose to do a joint f test to see whether any of the parameters should be 0. We also completed a t test to see individual significance against the yield.
