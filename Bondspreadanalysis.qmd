# Introduction {#sec-intro} 

Finding the micro-determinants for credit bonds is useful for finding what affects yields over time. 

Yield is described as the difference in 

This paper is structured as follows: @sec-lit is the literature review situating the research question, @sec-des contains the preliminary analyses, @sec-met contains the methodology, @sec-res contains the results, and @sec-hyp has the hypothesis testing. 

# Firm value and capital structure ratios

Enterprise value to sales measures how expensive a company is relative to its revenue. Thus, a high ratio means the market expects high growth (or the company is overvalued). 
Thus, a high enterprise value to sales means lower perceived risk and lower spreads.

PPE is actual long-term assets (machines, buildings, equipment). Thus, a high enterprise value to PPE means the firm is growth-oriente, but that also means it is riskier and higher spreads. 

High P/S -> confidence -> lower spreads

Book Value = Assets - Liabilities 
P/B <1 -> undervaluation -> financial distress -> higher spreads

Dividend yield -> higher MAY indicate risk

High RATE -> more efficient -> lower spreads

# profitability and operational efficiency 

operating margin = earnings before interest and taxes/revenue 
high margin -> lower default risk (firm is efficient) -> lower spreads

High total capital expenses to total assets -> lower spreads or less cash :\

low book value per share -> maybe bankrupt

High asset turnover -> efficient -> lower spreads

# Liquidity and Cash flow ratios

current ratio = current assets (cash + receivables + inventory)/ current liabilities (obligations due)
low current ratio -> liquidity risk -> higher spreads

Cash dividend coverage ratio = operating cash flow/cash dividends paid
lower coverage -> weak cash flow -> higher spreads

# Leverage and Capital Structure

high total debt/shareholder equity -> in debt -> higher spreads

high total debt/(total debt + equity) -> high reliance on debt -> high spreads

# Bond specific

Higher amount outstanding -> lower spreads (more liquid?)
smaller amount outstanding -> higher spreads

years to maturity -> more interest rate and credit risk -> higher spread (risk premium) 

low couponds -> high price sensitity? MAYBE. Higher does not not imply higher here

## Description of variables

The variables are as follows

| Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Issuer  | Name of the company that issued the bond |
| Spread | The difference between the bond's yield and the yield on a government bond of the same maturity. Measured in bps |
| Ticker Parent  | Identifier for the parent company |
| **Enterprise Value to Sales** | Measures how expensive a company is relative to its revenue |
| Enterprise Value to PPE | Measures valuation relative to tangible assets |
| **Price to Sales** | How much investors pay for $1 of revenue |
| **Price to Book Value** | Measures how expensive the firm is relative to accounting equity |
| Dividend Yield | Return shareholders receive from dividends |
| **Return on Average Total Equity** | How efficient the firm is with investments |
| **Operating Margin** | Core profibility measure |
| Total Capital Expenses to Total Assets | How much firm invests in long-term assets |
| Book Value per Share | Accounting value per share |
| **Asset Turnover** | Measures how well assets generate revenue |
| **Current Ratio** | Measures short-term liquidity |
| **Cash Dividend Coverage Ratio** | Measures if firm can pay dividends purely from operations |
| **Total Debt to Equity** | Measures financial leverage |
| **Total Debt to Total Capital** | Shows how much of capital is from debt |
| Amount Outstanding | Size of the bond |
| Years to Maturity | Number of years until the bond pays back its principal |
| Coupon | Annual payments made to bond holders |


## Statement of hypothesis/research question

The research question this paper will seek to answer is what are the micro-determinants of credit spread. We propose that total debt to equity, price to book value, return on average total equity, and current ratioare the micro-determinants affect the change in bond spreads over time.


# Literature Review {#sec-lit}

Total Debt to Equity + Total Debt to Total Capital @fu2021credit
"we assess the existence of a firm leverage effect"
"firm leverage appears to have a significant influence"

@wang2023liquidity
ROE “Return on net assets… the higher the ROE, the better the operating conditions and the ability to service debt.”
higher -> lower spreads
Current Ratio "“The higher the current ratio, the better the ability to service debt…the smaller the credit spread.”"

@kaviani2020policy
Operating Margin "“…operating income-to-sales ratio…"

@carvalho2023loan
Price to book value (Market-to-book) "“Borrower-level controls include Equity Volatility, Size, Firm Age, Profitability, Tangibility, Market-to-Book, Leverage, Rated.”"
amount outstanding (loan amount) “I define the net notional amount of credit risk outstanding for a given firm as:
NOf,t is analogous to the face value of debt outstanding in bond markets—it captures the net amount of protection sold…”
Years to maturity (loan maturity) “…a firm is defined as a combination of the underlying firm (e.g. Ford) and a maturity bucket (e.g. 0-2 years)… The maturity buckets I consider are (in years): 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and 10+.”

[@collin2001determinants] added total debt to equity and enterprice valuue to sales.

## Summary of key variables

Spread is numeric with a range from [-196.8, 395.8]. It had a mean of -14.6 and a standard deviation of 57.6. It had skweness of 1.017

PricetoBook Value is numeric with a range from [-10.3, 7.1]. It had a mean of 0.214 and a standard deviation of 1.17. It had skewness of 0.106.

Return on Average total equity was numeric with a range [-90.96, 135.03]. It had a mean of -0.47 and a standard deviation of 19.466. It had a skweness of 1.236.

Current Ratio is numeric with a range from [-1.47, 3.27]. It had a mean of -0.14 and a standard deviation of 0.395. It had a skewness of 2.86.

Total Debt to Equity is numeric with range from [-80.36, 452.69]. It had a mean of 30.07 and a standard deviation of 39.65. It had a skewness of 39.65. 

# Methodology {#sec-met}
## Clear statement of the model and its assumptions

$$
y= \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}log(x_1)+\beta_{2}x_2 + \beta_{3}log(x_3)+\beta_{4}x_4
$$

Where $y$ is the spread of bonds, $x_1$ is TotalDebttoEquity, $x_2$ is PricetoBookValue, $x_3$ to ReturnonAvgTotalEquity, and $x_4$ is CurrentRatio.

**Linearity in Parameters**

From the model above, it is clear that the model is linear in parameters. 

**Random Sampling** 

This is an assumption about the data given. It is randomly sampled. 

**No Perfect Collinearity**

We ran correlation between all the variables and got the following table. Since none of the columns are a repeat, there is no perfect collinearity.

![](collinearityy.png){width=50%, fig-align="center"}
**Zero Conditional Mean**

This is an assumption about the population. 

**Homoskedasticty**

We performed robust on all our entries and did not assume homoskedasticity. 

Thus, following all these assumptions, the model is consistent and unbiased

## Specification tests

Before Adjusting for non linearity: F(12,809) value for estat ovtest, rhs ( linearity test)  = 6.22 with p value 0.0000 

After adjusting for non linearity (the model with logs and nooooo cubes) : estat ovtest, rhs F(12, 46) value is 1.46 with p-value 0.1749

The estat ovtest (test for omitted variable bias) only run after adjusting for non linearity gave F(3,55) value 1.55 with p-value 0.2129


## Robustness considerations 

For robustness considerations, we used robust every time we used regression. Thus, we never assumed homoskedasticity.

## Choise of appropriate test

We chose to do a joint f test to see whether any of the parameters should be 0. We also completed a t test to see individual significance against the yield.
